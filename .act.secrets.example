# These secrets are used when running act locally
#
# Note: If you have secrets configured in ~/.actrc, you can leave these commented
# and act will use the values from ~/.actrc instead
#
# To use these values, uncomment and set them:
# - Remove the # at the beginning of the line
# - Replace the placeholder values with your actual tokens

# GitHub Token (for testing GitHub API calls)
# This is automatically provided by act as GITHUB_TOKEN, but you can override it
# GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_github_token_here

# Custom GitHub Token (for testing custom token functionality)
# Used by the "Test action - Custom token" integration test
# CUSTOM_GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_custom_github_token_here

# Gitea Token (for testing self-hosted Gitea instances)
# Used for testing git.ravenwolf.org and other self-hosted instances
# GITEA_TOKEN=your_gitea_token_here

# Bitbucket Token (for testing Bitbucket API calls)
# BITBUCKET_TOKEN=your_bitbucket_token_here

# NPM Registry Token (required for CI workflows that run npm ci)
# Token for authenticating with git.ravenwolf.org npm registry (git-platform-detector).
# For local act runs, use the same value as GITEA_TOKEN from ~/.actrc
# NPM_REGISTRY_TOKEN=your-npm-registry-token
